# Find random places to hang out, powered by Google Maps API

***

## Description

This simple project uses the Google Maps Places and Maps JavaScript APIs to find random hangouts within a specified radius.

The idea was to always have an answer to "Where should we go next weekend?".

**NOTE:** I'm fully aware that the API key is visible. Unfortunately, as of June 7th 2023, they cannot be hidden when using plain JavaScript. However, I've set up restrictions and followed all of the best practices Google recommends with the API keys. Please do not send PRs about this.

## Usage

- Click "Pick Location" then anywhere on the map to place a marker, or search for an address.
- Click "Search Controls" to modify your search preferences.
- Click "Find" for a random location.
